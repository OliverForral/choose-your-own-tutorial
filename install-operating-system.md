# Install Operating System

## Required Steps

There are no required steps.

## Wake Up

You wake up with no memory of what you are doing or how you got here.
There appears to be a computer surrounded by USB sticks.
You turn the computer on to find out it has no operating system.  
You have a variety of USB sticks to choose from, but only a few seem to be bootable.
