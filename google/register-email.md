# Register Google Email

## Not The Best User Experience

You make your way to [Google](https://www.google.com) and you don't see any way to register a new email address.
You realize that Google is not the best at user experience
and you decide to click on the "Sign In" button on the top right of the page.  
It looks like a typical sign in screen.
The only problem is that you do not have an account to sign in with.
Since none of the options seem to be what you want, you click on the "More Options" link.
It turned out to be fruitful and a dialog appears.
You click on the "Create Account" link.
