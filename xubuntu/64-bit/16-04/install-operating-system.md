# Install Operating System 64-bit Xubuntu 16.04

## Welcome Screen

### Try Xubuntu Or Install Xubuntu

At this point, you see a "Try Xubuntu" button and a "Install Xubuntu" button.
Since you plan to install other applications, you decided to click the "Install Xubuntu" button.

### Preparing To Install Xubuntu

You now see two checkboxes
The first checkbox is for downloading updates while the operating system in installing.
It is currently disabled since the computer is not connected to the internet.
The second checkbox is for installing third-party software, which may include some that are proprietary.
You decide to connect to the internet.
On the top right of the screen, you see a dialog that says "Wi-Fi Networks Available"
and you click the icon that has an up arrow and a down arrow.
You typed in wifi information that you found on one of the sticky notes
and now the "up arrow and down arrow" icon has turned into a signal icon.
You decide to check both boxes and click the "Continue" button.

### Installation Type

Since there were no previously installed operating systems,
there was only one radio button for erasing the disk and installing Xubuntu.
You leave the other checkboxes clear since you do not need the extra security and you click the "Install Now" button.
